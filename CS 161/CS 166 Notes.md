[CS 166 Notes](/ugxqHnCfRg2Jet5PdxVOZw)
===

Hi there! I'm Stephen Reyes, CS Major, 5th Year. This is for the Fall 2018 Semester, CS 166 (Cryptography) class for context, under Professor Fabio de Troia.

These are my personal notes of the class, and as such are my personal interpretation. In no way should these be used as a substitution for reading the lecture slides and taking your own notes, but they may still be useful for getting the general gist of the content.

I, the author, give you, the user, the explicit ability to use these notes in any way deemed appropriate for your studies.

Good luck!
